Create a PowerShell script for a Windows Server Active Directory lab with the following requirements:

Environment:
- Active Directory Domain Services already installed
- Domain: corp.kalytpon.com
- UPN/email suffix: kalytpon.com
- Script will be run as Domain Admin on the Domain Controller
- ActiveDirectory PowerShell module available

Objectives:
1. Create an Organizational Unit (OU) hierarchy for a lab named "Kalypton.Universe"
2. Use superhero-themed names for OUs and groups, but keep them realistic and relevant to Active Directory
3. Create security groups and users based on Marvel and DC characters (using their real civilian names)

OU Requirements:
- Root OU: Kalypton.Universe
- Under Kalypton.Universe:
  - OU-Marvel-Operations
    - Users
    - Admins
  - OU-DC-Operations
    - Users
    - Admins
  - Groups (for all security groups)

Group Requirements:
- Create Global Security Groups:
  - SG-HERO-Marvel-Users
  - SG-HERO-Marvel-Admins
  - SG-HERO-DC-Users
  - SG-HERO-DC-Admins
- Place all groups in the "Groups" OU
- Use clear descriptions for each group

User Requirements:
- Create users using real civilian names of Marvel and DC characters
- Username format (samAccountName and UPN prefix): firstname.lastname (lowercase)
- UPN/email format: firstname.lastname@kalytpon.com
- All users use the same password: GreatWhite!
- PasswordNeverExpires = True
- CannotChangePassword = True
- Accounts must be enabled at creation
- Handle the 20-character samAccountName limit safely
- Skip user creation if the user already exists

Group Membership:
- Marvel users added to SG-HERO-Marvel-Users
- Marvel admins added to SG-HERO-Marvel-Admins
- DC users added to SG-HERO-DC-Users
- DC admins added to SG-HERO-DC-Admins

Script Behavior & Output:
- Explicitly print output for each action:
  - OU created or already exists
  - Group created or already exists
  - Each user created (name, UPN, OU, group membership)
  - Users skipped if they already exist
- Use readable, labeled console output suitable for screenshots
- Avoid silent failures

Best Practices:
- Use functions for OU creation, group creation, and user creation
- Protect OUs from accidental deletion
- Ensure the UPN suffix kalytpon.com exists in Active Directory
- Use clear variable names and comments
- Make the script idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

Deliverable:
- A single, complete PowerShell script ready to paste and run
